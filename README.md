# Fancy-WebSockets
Yet another websocket lib, but oversimplified 

## Project is not finished yet. Fundamental parts are already built -- there's only a little bit of twiddling with message delivery left

# Current objectives
<ul>
    <li>Make project look more like a library(now it's just unusable pile of code)</li>
    <li>Implement a chat on top of it</li>
</ul>
